<h1 align="center">Downloading the IRTH program</h1>
<p>
Several users requested that a local copy of the IRTH program be made available so that they can run the program
when no internet connection is available. This is the obvious advantage of having a local copy of the program. The
disadvantage is that the user may miss future updates to the program. Please check periodically to see if the last
update date is later than the date you downloaded the program.
</p>
<p>
You are welcome to copy and distribute this program to as many people as you like if you do not modify it and if
you give it away. The IRTH program is <em>not</em> to be sold.
</p>
<p>
The download link below will place a WinZip archive file on your computer disk. You will need to extract the files
from the archive to a folder of your choice, for instance C:\IRTH. 
</p>
<p>
To run the program, simply double click on the file irth.html
