		<div align="center"><h1>Using the Islamic Inheritance Program (IRTH)</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			The IRTH program is based on the book "Fiqh-us-Sunna" by Assayyed Sabeq. It was 
			tested against over 160 cases, among which are all the cases listed in the ISNA 
			booklet "Last Will and Testament". Also tested are the famous Shafii, Shuraih, 
			Ali, Omar and Abu-Bakr challenges.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are welcome to copy and distribute the source code of this program to as 
			many people as you like at <em>no cost</em>. It is <strong>not</strong> to be sold.
		</p>
		<p>
			The IRTH program calculates inheritance portions due to heirs according to Islamic 
			Law. The program screen displays heir categories, e.g., sons, daughters, 
			...etc. Simply, enter the number of heirs in each category in the two columns 
			labeled "Number of heirs". If there are no heirs in a given category, enter 0 
			or leave the category blank. When the last category is entered, click the 
			button labeled "Calculate". 
			<script type="text/javascript" src="env.js"/></script>
			<script type="text/javascript"><!--
			if (isModern || isIE)
			{
				document.write("The portions due each of the heirs will be displayed in the two columns labeled \"Each inherits\" next to the heir category.") 
			}
			else
			{
				document.write("The portions due each of the heirs will be displayed in a new window.")
			}
			--></script>
			If you want to donate a part of your estate, not to exceed a third of it, to a 
			person who is not an eligible heir, you can do so by clicking on "Preferences",
			and typing the bequest as a fraction of the estate, e.g., 1/4, before you click
			on "Calculate". The preferences section also allows you to specify your preferred
			juristic school.

		<p>The program was successfully tested using Internet Explorer versions 5.5 and above, Netscape Navigator versions 6.2 through 7.1, Mozilla version 1.4, America Online versions 6.0 through 9.0, Firefox, Chrome
		and Safari. 
			It does <em>not</em> run under Netscape Navigator versions 4.5 or earlier, nor the Opera browser. It may or may not run on Windows 7. I recommend <a href="http://www.mozilla.com" target="_blank">Firefox.</a>
